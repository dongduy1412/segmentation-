# Future implementation notes:
"""
To implement this class, we will need:

1. Grounding DINO:
   - Install: pip install groundingdino-py
   - Or from source: https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO
   - Provides zero-shot object detection with text prompts
   
2. Mask2Former:
   - Install: pip install mask2former
   - From Hugging Face: transformers library
   - Model: facebook/mask2former-swin-large-ade-semantic
   
3. Integration approach:
   - Use Grounding DINO to detect objects based on text prompts
   - Pass detection boxes to Mask2Former for segmentation
   - Or use Mask2Former directly for semantic segmentation
   
4. Example usage (future):
   ```python
   segmenter = GroundingDINOSegmenter()
   image, results = segmenter.segment_with_text_prompt(
       "room.jpg",
       text_prompt="walls. floors. furniture. windows. doors."
   )
   ```
   
5. Advantages over YOLO+SAM:
   - No need for predefined classes
   - Natural language queries
   - Can detect novel/unseen objects
   - Better for specific domain tasks
